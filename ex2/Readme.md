# Introduction

<p> In this exercise, you will implement logistic regression and apply it to two diﬀerent datasets. Before starting on the programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.</p>

<p>To get started with the exercise, you will need to download the starter code and unzip its contents to the directory where you wish to complete the exercise. If needed, use the cd command in Octave/MATLAB to change to this directory before starting this exercise.</p>

<p>You can also ﬁnd instructions for installing Octave/MATLAB in the “Environment Setup Instructions” of the course website.</p>

## Files included in this exercise
<p> ex2.m - Octave/MATLAB script that steps you through the exercise</p>
<p> ex2_reg.m - Octave/MATLAB script for the later parts of the exercise</p>
<p> ex2data1.txt - Training set for the ﬁrst half of the exercise</p>
<p> ex2data2.txt - Training set for the second half of the exercise</p>
<p> submit.m - Submission script that sends your solutions to our servers</p>
<p> mapFeature.m - Function to generate polynomial features</p>
<p> plotDecisionBoundary.m - Function to plot classiﬁer’s decision boundary</p>

<p> Files needed to complete
<ul>
  <li> plotData.m - Function to plot 2D classiﬁcation data</li>
  <li> sigmoid.m - Sigmoid Function</li>
  <li> costFunction.m - Logistic Regression Cost Function</li>
  <li> predict.m - Logistic Regression Prediction Function</li>
  <li> costFunctionReg.m - Regularized Logistic Regression Cost</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> Throughout the exercise, you will be using the scripts ex2.m and ex2 reg.m. These scripts set up the dataset for the problems and make calls to functions that you will write. You do not need to modify either of them. You are only required to modify functions in other ﬁles, by following the instructions in this assignment.</p>

<p> Optional Exercises:</p>

<p> Logistic Regression.ipynb - Logistic Regression programming exercise in Python</p>
<p> <b>Note</b>: Logistic regression with regularization has been getting few errors. Will try and make it work as soon as possible!</p>
